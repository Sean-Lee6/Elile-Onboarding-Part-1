**Important**

Main file: Please **click the link:** "[https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/Sean-Lee6/Elile-Onboarding-Part-1/blob/main/Power_Plant_Analysis.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/Sean-Lee6/Elile-Onboarding-Part-1/blob/main/Power_Plant_Analysis.html))" for the analysis and model evaluations. Github doesn't preserve color gradients for my notebook, and doesn't render my html file unless by using the link above, which I have to manually create. **Do not** just click the HTML file on github: it won't show you the output, just the raw html code.

We conduct an analysis of an Indian power plant from May to June 2017, and create models to predict the AC power output for the plant at a given time. The most important factors were the specific time of day and the temperature. The random forest model and optimized LSTM  models performed the best.

I have included the stored pickle file for the optimized LSTM, but the random forest pickle file is too large to upload to Github.
