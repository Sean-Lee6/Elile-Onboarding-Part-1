Please refer to "Power_Plant_Analysis.html" for the analysis and model evaluations. It also preserves my color maps gradients for the visualizations.

We conduct an analysis of an Indian power plant from May to June 2017, and create models to predict the AC power output for the plant at a given time. The most important factors were the specific time of day and the temperature. The random forest model and optimized LSTM  models performed the best.

I have included the stored pickle file for the optimized LSTM, but the random forest pickle file is too large to upload to Github.
